# Covid-19 worldwide Situation 

My goal was to show at a glance what percentage of the population was infected with Covid-19, between January 2020 and June 2021. 

Part 1 - Data Exploration with Excel and SSMS


The first part of the project involved downloading and cleaning the data set in Excel, and creating two tables with the total number of vaccinations and the rate of deaths around the world. 

The data source used is Our World in Data: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.

Next, I uploaded the two newly created tables into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and queried the data. 



Part 2 - Data Visualisation in Tableau 


The dashboard represents the Covid-19 data across the world, following the exploration in part 1, where I queried the dataset using #SQL, sorting and manipulating data in a few different ways. 

I used Tableau Public to save my dashboard, after worked in MS Excel to create four tables needed, based on my queries in #SSMS. 

Here you can find my interactive dashboard of Covid-19 data across the world:
